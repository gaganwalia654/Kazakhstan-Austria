        <p>The highest scoring team in UEFA Nations League B will face-off against its least effective offense when Austria travels to face Kazakhstan at Central Stadium in Almaty on Thursday. Das Team will have one eye on the summit of Group B3 as it comes into this clash level on points with Norway, while Kazakhstan is set to be relegated to the third tier of the competition unless it can get a first win on the board. Ralf Rangnick’s men romped to a one-sided 4-0 triumph over the Hawks when these teams faced off last month, and a repeat of that result here could steer them to the top of the pile.</p>

<p>Seven defeats in its last eight outings has left Kazakhstan struggling for morale as a dangerous-looking Austria comes to town seeking automatic promotion to Nations League A.</p>



<p>Only the first place finisher in each group will automatically climb to the next rung on the ladder, and Group B3 couldn’t be any tighter with the top three teams each level on points.</p>



<p>Austria has revived its chances of going up with back-to-back wins in October, most notably smashing five past table leader Norway last time out to get things back on track.</p>
